## Problem Solving in Python (CSC121, Fall 2019)
This repository contains the homework assignments and projects from my CSC121 Problem Solving class. The course focused on foundational programming concepts in Python, with an emphasis on developing problem-solving skills through writing clean, efficient, and logical code. We also explored object-oriented programming concepts to structure code in a more modular and reusable way.
### Topics Covered
- Lists and Arrays: Working with sequences of data, list comprehensions, and array manipulations.
- Dictionaries: Key-value pair data structures, common dictionary operations, and use cases.
- Control Structures: Using for loops and while loops to iterate through data and control the flow of programs.
- Recursion: Solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, including classic recursive problems like factorial and Fibonacci sequences.
- Basic Algorithms: Sorting, searching, and understanding the logic behind common algorithms.
- Function Design: Writing functions to break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable units, including recursive function design.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
  * Classes and Objects: Designing and using custom data types with attributes and methods.
  * Inheritance and Polymorphism: Reusing code through inheritance, and creating flexible designs using polymorphism.
  * Encapsulation and Abstraction: Encapsulating data and behavior, and designing abstracted models that simplify complexity.
